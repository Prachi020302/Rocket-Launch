This is a terminal based application that simulates a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit, while providing real-time updates to the user. The simulator will operate in discrete time steps, each representing one second of the mission.

Pre-launch checks: "All systems are ready. Initiate launch sequence to proceed."
Each Second of Flight: "Stage: 1, Fuel: 90%, Altitude: 10 km, Speed: 1000 km/h"
Stage Separation : "Stage 1 complete. Separating stage. Entering Stage 2."
Orbit Placement: "Orbit achieved! Mission Successful."
Mission Failure: "Rocket is out of fuel. Mission failed!!"
